All theme colors are **dark mode** and **no light mode** is currently available.
*By the way, if you're using light mode, you should really go to therapy.*

### Informations
---
This extension was entirely developed in **JavaScript** (with some JSON/CSS/HTML but it's not really the main of the code).
The `vscode`, `fs` and `path` modules were used in the code and the `vsce` module to create the .vsix file of the extension.
Reading the documentation, programming and testing took me about **4/5 working days**.
The **2.0.0 of the extension has a totally different functioning from the 1.0.0** (all the code has been modified).
There is also **no license** for this extension and the code.

### Warnings
---
The extension, for its proper functioning, modifies the files that VSCode uses to work.
As a result, **VSCode may get corrupted** if the microsoft team changes a large part of the VSCode code.
If that happens, don't panic, just **reinstall VSCode** and everything will be back to normal.
